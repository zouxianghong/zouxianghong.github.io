  We propose PatchAugNet, which utilizes patch feature augmentation and adaptive pyramid feature aggregation to achieve better performance and generalizability for Heterogeneous Point Cloud-based Place Recognition (PCPR) tasks. The comprehensive experimental results indicate that PatchAugNet achieves SOTA performance with 83.43% recall@top1% and 60.34% recall@top1 on unseen large-scale street scenes, outperforming existing SOTA PCPR methods by +9.57 recall@top1% and +15.50 recall@top1, while exhibiting better generalizability.
