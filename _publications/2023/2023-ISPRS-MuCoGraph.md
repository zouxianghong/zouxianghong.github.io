  We present MuCoGraph, which introduces multi-scale constraints to establish the correct correspondences for revisited areas, and formulates an enhanced pose graph for position inconsistency correction. The proposed method was used to correct the MLS point cloud position inconsistency in three datasets. The average three-dimensional distance of the checkpoints was reduced from 0.362 m, 0.108 m, and 1.027 m to 0.057 m, 0.033 m, and 0.051 m for datasets I, II, and III respectively. In addition, the root-mean-square error of all three datasets was less than 0.04 m after correction. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method can automatically locate and correct the position inconsistency of MLS point clouds, showing good robustness and effectiveness.
