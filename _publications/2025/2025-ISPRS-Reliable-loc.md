   We propose a LiDAR-based reliable global localization method, Reliable-loc, which achieves better robustness in complex large-scale outdoor scenes with insufficient features and incomplete coverage of the prior map. The experimental results indicate that Reliable-loc exhibits high robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in large-scale, complex street scenes, with a position accuracy of ±2.91 m, yaw accuracy of ±3.74 degrees, and achieves real-time performance.
